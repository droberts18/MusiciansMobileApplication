		<h2><b>Silvia Rodriguez</b></h2>
		<p>My name is Silvia Rodriguez-Garcilazo. I was born and raised in the small town of Othello. I'm currently attending Whitworth University 
		   where I'm double majoring in Sociology-Criminal Justice Track, Spanish, and a minor in psychology. Two of my passions are music and learning 
		   about different cultures. My love of music has always been part of my life. I'm able to play the flute and the piccolo. 
		   I have been playing the flute for nine years and the piccolo for two. I also, hope to incorporate my knowledge of language and culture 
		   for many users to take advantage of this product.

		<h2><b>Drew Roberts</b></h2>
		<p>My name is Drew Roberts and I'm a senior at Whitworth University, finishing up a B.A. in Computer Science (Business specification) and a general Business minor.
		   Prior to working on this product, I've worked on multiple different iOS applications for fun, but never put any on the App Store.  I have experience in Swift and
		   Java, but I feel much more comfortable with Swift.  As for musical experience, I played the piano for about 5 years before moving onto the drums and eventually guitar, both of which I still play today.
		   I have some experience being in a band, as I played in my church's worship band and a band with friends throughout high school.  I hope to bring my coding skills
		   and part of my experience learning instruments and playing music into this product.
